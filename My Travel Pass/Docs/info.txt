My spouse from china , who holds long term visit pass which has expired, already 
successfully applied MyTravelPass last week. She is planning to travel to Malaysia to
 unite with family. My question is that Does She still need to apply Travel Visa First before travel to Malaysia?
We already have temujanji to renew Social pass in Feb soon.
